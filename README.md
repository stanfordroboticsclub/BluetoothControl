Quick and nasty combination of [Web Bluetooth Terminal](https://github.com/loginov-rocks/Web-Bluetooth-Terminal) and [Joystick](https://github.com/bobboteck/JoyStick) for [EE64](ee64.stanford.edu)

The AT09 Bluetooth modules use a differnt line ending from the HM10 so we needed to write our own app instead of using [Blue Arduino](https://sites.google.com/stonybrook.edu/arduinoble/?pli=1).

Works only in Chrome on most OSes. On iOS its doesn't work on Chrome but you can use [Bluefy](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bluefy-web-ble-browser/id1492822055)
